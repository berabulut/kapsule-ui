        <i>
          <b>In Short:</b> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol
          (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected
          automatically when you visit our Website.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or
        navigate the Website. This information does not reveal your specific
        identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device
        and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device
        characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs,
        device name, country, location, information about how and when you use
        our Website and other technical information. This information is
        primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Website,
        and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes
      </p>
      <p>
        Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and
        similar technologies.
      </p>
      <p>The information we collect includes:</p>

      <ul className={styles.list}>

          diagnostic, usage and performance information our servers
          automatically collect when you access or use our Website and which we
          record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log
          data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and
          settings and information about your activity in the Website (such as
          the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files
          viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which features you
          use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports
          (sometimes called 'crash dumps') and hardware settings).
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Device Data.</i> We collect device data such as information about
          your computer, phone, tablet or other device you use to access the

          application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware
          model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating
          system and system configuration information.

        <li>
          <i>Location Data.</i> We collect location data such as information
          about your device's location, which can be either precise or
          imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
          settings of the device you use to access the Website. For example, we
          may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that
          tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt
          out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing
          access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on
          your device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be
          able to use certain aspects of the Services.

      <h2>4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>

      <p className={styles.short}>
        <i>
          <b>In Short:</b> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to
          collect and store your information.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons
        and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about
        how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is
        set out in our Cookie Notice.
      </p>

      <h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

      <p className={styles.short}>
        <i>
          <b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to
          fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise
          required by law.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

      <h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

      <p className={styles.short}>
        <i>
          <b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a
          system of organizational and technical security measures.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
        storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
        promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
        third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
        collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
        our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only
        access the Website within a secure environment.

      </p>
      <p>
        If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
        you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note
        however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing

        other than consent.
      </p>

      <h2>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
